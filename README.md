# hoaaiww_measure_speed
- A very simple and useful script to measure a vehicles 0-100 time

- **Get and download [hoaaiww_measure_speed](https://github.com/hoaaiww/hoaaiww_measure_speed/releases/latest)!**

# Feautres
- Command based. Just type `/measurespeed
- KMH and MPH can be set
- 0ms while unused
- Fixes and freezes vehicle before measuring time

- Automatically detects and ends the event if player released the accelerator before the vehicle would reach 100 kmh/mph

These settings can be set in the `fxmanifest.lua`:
```lua
use_kmh 'yes' -- if 'no' then the script will use MPH instead
check_for_updates 'yes' -- if 'no' then the script wont check for updates
```
